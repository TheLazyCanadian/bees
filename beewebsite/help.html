		<h3>How We Can Help</h3>
			<p>There are many different ways that single people by themselves can help keep the bee population alive as well as the population in general can help.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>If you spot a bee hive on your property, don't call an exterminator or blast them with bug spray. Most of the time when you see the swarm, they are actually just relocating for the spring and just trying to protect their queen. They will be completely harmless, and will move on when they are ready. If you feel the need to, call a local bee keeper to make sure they get relocated safely.
			</p>

			<p>Plant flowers/plants that are native to your area. That's really important! See what grows naturally around you. Don't mow down dandelions in the spring. That's the first food source bees have access to. Make a sugar water pitstop for them. Making faux nectar just like we do for hummingbirds. Support farmers! Farmers means bees pollinating and many of them keep hives just for this purpose. Start a hobby hive if you can. If you find a hive that needs to go, don't just destroy it! Call around and you should be able to find someone more than willing to collect it for relocation. Look for local bee keepers. Buy local honey and wax products. Supporting bee keepers supports happy, healthy bees!
