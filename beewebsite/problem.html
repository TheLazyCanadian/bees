			<h3>The Problem</h3>
		<p style="text-align:center;">For about the past 10 years bees have been dying at a record rate, with up to 30 percent per year, causing a total loss of domesticated honeybee hives in the United States worth an estimated $2 Billion USD.
			<br>
			<br>
		The main cause is Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD), which is when the worker bees leave the hive behind, leaving the hive and the queen bee unattended, leading to the death of the queen bee and the collapse of the hive. The main causes of CCD are:
		</p>
		<ul style="list-style: none;">
			<li>- pesticides making their way to the bees through the trophic network
			<li>- changes in the use of land where natural populations of bees used to forage
			<li>- poor nutrition due the use of monocultures
			<li>- stress due to poor management practices by beekeepers and farmers
			<li>- natural bee diseases increasing in number
			
		<p>Naturally, beehives are prone to collapse, but since the mid 2000s, beekeepers and farmers have noticed the rate at which hives are collapsing is increasing at a pace faster than a new hive can be formed.

		<h3> Why They're Important</h3>
		<p>Bees are a group of species that have a few particular things in common that make them extremely necessary for plant life. They need nectar for their food and young.Because they need nectar, and many bee species live in hives, they need a LOT of nectar.Combine these two things and it means bees are one of the few insect groups that can be relied upon to consistently visit hundreds, if not thousands of flowers in short amount of time. This means that a plant that can attract the bees is much more likely to be able to spread its pollen to another species, just from the sheer number of flowers a bee is going to visit. This allows for plant reproduction, which is direct precursor to how many of our base foods are produced (seeds, fruits, leaves, etc.)Now why would losing the bees be a problem? Mainly because no other group of species on earth could do exactly what they do. What a Honeybee does regularly could take a dozen species of birds, flies, bats, and beetles to do, and it wouldn't be as effective. Many species of plants have a relationship with bees that relies on certain physical characteristics of a bee species to allow pollination, something that another species of bee, let alone another insect do.So we lose the bees, we lose the pollination, we lose the pollination, we lose a majority of food crops in the world.
